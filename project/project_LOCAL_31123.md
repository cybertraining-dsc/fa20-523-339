## Abstract
Withthe passage of time, the online shopping and E-commerce have now become one of the most popular events for citizen's life and society. Millions of goods are now sale online to the customers all over the world. With the 5G technology's implementation is inevitable. These activities will create millions of data about customer's behaviors like how they value products, how they purchase or sale the products and how they review for the goods purchase. These data will have a tremendous contribution for corporations to analyze. These data can not only help convince the current strategies of the E-commerce is on a right track, but also a potential way to see which step E-commerce can make up for attracting more customers to buy the goods. At the same time, these data can also be implemented as a way for recommendation strategies for E-commerce. It will help customers find the next products they like in a short period by implementing machine learning technology on Big Data. The corporations can also enjoy the increase of sale and potential of more attraction for recommendation strategies. A better recommendation strategy as well as better data analysis strategies on E-commerce are now the new trend for massive data scientists and researchers’ target. Therefore, this field is now one the most popular research area in the data science fields.

## 1. Introduction

Big data have many applications in the scientific research and business, from those in the hardware perspective like Higgs Discovery to the software perspective like E-commence. In these aspects, I am mostly interested in big data application in the business especially in the area where using big data to analysis customer behavior and then make a recommendation strategy to induce customers purchase the best fit-in goods. The recommendation strategies and customer behavior analysis are now playing the key role for all E-commerce competitiveness and be highly valued and researched by scientists around the world. It could be quite difficult to make a breakthrough in this area. However, I still would like to make a taste on it by using Amazon’s multiple datasets to see what the strategies will be. The project will be finished by myself with a couple Datasets provided by Amazon stated following.

In the final project, I will focus on use the customer review data to perform data analysis technology and then use different machine learning methods to give customers' recommendation products based on the data. A feature is that this work will try to use different machine learning technologies which can be able to see how exactly a recommendation will be make in E-commerce area


## 2. Choice of Data-sets

Upon exploring a wide array of available datasets, I will be using the dataset called from Amazon Review Data. Particularly, since the dataset is now reach billions of amount, I will use the subcategery gift card as an example, since the overall product type is closed to 2000 and the amount of data retrieved is currently in the right amount of training and testing. This fact can help to see if the machine learning strategies work in the cases. 


   
## 3. Methodology

The first step will data collection and data cleaning. The second step will be use data to perform machine learning methods and strech several visualizations based on that. The final step is using the data to mimic a real-world recommendations products within a random-selected dataset. The final result and overall correctness will be recorded for the conclusion. 

##Outline of plan
- Week 9-Week 10 Clean and process the data for the project -finished
- Week 10-Week 11 Implement Machine Learning Methods - KNN implemented and waiting for the useage
- Week 11- Week 12 Build the recommendation strategies

## 5. Inference

This section will be addressed upon project completion.

## 6. Conclusion

This section will be addressed upon project completion.
