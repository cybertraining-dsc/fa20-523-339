## Abstract

As a result of last twenty year's Internet development in the global, E-commerce industry is getting stronger and stronger. While customers enjoyed their convenient online purchase environment, the E-commerce see the potential for the data and information customer left during their online-shopping process. One fundamental usage for this information is to perform Recommendation Strategy to give customer potential products they would also like to purchase.  This report will try to build a User-Based Collaborative Filtering strategy to give customer recommendation products based on the database of previous customer purchase records. This report will start with an overview for the background and then an expansion for the dataset it chosen *Amazon Review Data*. After that each step for the code and step made in a corresponding file *Big_tata_Application_in_E_commense.ipynb* will be illustrated and the User-Based Collaborative Filtering strategy will be presented step by step.

## 1. Introduction

Big data have many applications in the scientific research and business, from those in the hardware perspective like Higgs Discovery to the software perspective like E-commence. However, with the passage of time, the online shopping and E-commerce have now become one of the most popular events for citizen's life and society. Millions of goods are now sale online to the customers all over the world. With the 5G technology's implementation is inevitable. These activities will create millions of data about customer's behaviors like how they value products, how they purchase or sale the products and how they review for the goods purchase. These data will have a tremendous contribution for corporations to analyze. These data can not only help convince the current strategies of the E-commerce is on a right track, but also a potential way to see which step E-commerce can make up for attracting more customers to buy the goods. At the same time, these data can also be implemented as a way for recommendation strategies for E-commerce. It will help customers find the next products they like in a short period by implementing machine learning technology on Big Data. The corporations also can enjoy the increase of sale and potential of more attraction for recommendation strategies. A better recommendation strategy on E-commerce is now the new trend for massive data scientists and researchersâ€™ target. Therefore, this field is now one the most popular research area in the data science fields. 

In this final project, An User-Based Collaborative Filtering Strategy will be implemented to get a taste on the recommendation strategy based on Customer's Gift card purchase record and the item they also viewed and bought. The logic behind the algorithm is the following: A used record indicates that customer who bought the product A and also view/buy products B&C. They when a new customer comes and indicates his interest of B&C, the product A would be recommended to him. This logic is addressed based on daily-experience of customer behaviors on their E-commerse experience. 

## 2. Background

Recommendation Strategy is a quite popular research area in recent years with a strong real-world influence. It is largely used in E-commerse platform like Taobao, Amazon,etc. Therefore, It is obvious that there are plenty of recommendation strategy have been done. Though every E-commerse's recommendation algorithm may be different with each other, the most poplular techique for recommendation systems is called Collaborative Filtering. It is a techique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. During this techique, the memory-based method is considered in this report since it uses dataset to calculate the prediction by using statistical techniques. This strategy will be able to fulfill in local environment with a proper dataset. There are two kinds of memory-based method available in the market: *User-Based Collaborative Filtering*, *Item-Based Collaborative Filtering*.[^1] This project will be only focus on User-Based Collaborative Filtering Strategy since Item-Based Collaborative Filtering requires a customer review rate for evaluation. The dataset available in the market does not have that attribute and therefore be unlikely to implement in that way. 

## 3. Choice of Data-sets


The dataset for this study is called *Amazon Review Data* [^2]. Particularly, since the dataset is now reach billions of amount,the subcategery gift card will be used as an example, since the overall customer record is 1547 and the amount of data retrieved is currently in the right amount of training. This fact can help to perform User-Based Collaborative Filtering in a control timeline.

   
## 4. Data Preprocessing and cleaning


The first step will be data collection and data cleaning. The raw data-set is imported directly from data-set contributors' online storage *meta_Gift_Cards.json.gz* [^3] to Google Colab notebook. The raw database will be the following:
